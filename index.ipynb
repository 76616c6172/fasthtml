    "`fasthtml` is a library for writing fast and scalable Starlette-powered web applications, without having to learn much (if any!) Starlette. Instead, you just use plain python functions for each page in your app -- you don't even need to learn Javascript. The finished app will be about as fast as a Python web server can be (which is pretty fast -- e.g. Instagram runs on Python), and you can create pretty much anything. This isn't one of those stripped-down dashboard making thingies.\n",
