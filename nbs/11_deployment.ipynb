    "To deploy to railway, you need to have a Railway account and the Railway CLI installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Railway account at [railway.app](https://railway.app/)\n",
    "2. Install the Railway CLI for your [operating system](https://docs.railway.app/guides/cli#installing-the-cli).\n",
    "3. Run `railway login` to log in to your Railway account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, navigate to the directory containing your FastHTML app and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "fh_railway_deploy <app-name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",

    "`fh_railway_deploy` runs the following commands behind the scenes for you:\n",

    "railway domain\n",

    "It handles automatically linking your current app to a railway project, setting up all the environment variables such as the port to listen on and setting up a `requirements.txt` if you haven't one already."
