Don’t worry, we still get this too, despite having used `nbdev` for a wide range of “very serious” software projects over the last three years, including deep learning libraries, API clients, Python language extensions, terminal user interfaces, web frameworks, and more!\n",

Traditional programming environments throw away the result of your exploration in REPLs or notebooks. `nbdev` makes exploration an integral part of your workflow, all while promoting software engineering best practices.\n"

    "FastHTML uses a `setup.py` module instead of a `pyproject.toml` file to configure itself for installation. The reason for this is `pyproject.toml` is not compatible with [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), which is what is used to write and build FastHTML.\n",

    "The nbdev project spent around a year trying to move to pyproject.toml but there was insufficient functionality in the toml-based approach to complete the transition. We invite those interested in moving this project `pyproject.toml` to contribute their efforts to making [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) work with that format."
