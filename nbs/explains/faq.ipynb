    "[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&ab_channel=JeremyHoward). Don’t worry, we still get this too, despite having used `nbdev` for a wide range of “very serious” software projects over the last three years, including deep learning libraries, API clients, Python language extensions, terminal user interfaces, web frameworks, and more!\n",
    "\n",
    "[nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) is a Jupyter-powered tool for writing software. Traditional programming environments throw away the result of your exploration in REPLs or notebooks. `nbdev` makes exploration an integral part of your workflow, all while promoting software engineering best practices.\n"

    "\n",
    "FastHTML uses a `setup.py` module instead of a `pyproject.toml` file to configure itself for installation. The reason for this is `pyproject.toml` is not compatible with [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), which is what is used to write and build FastHTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nbdev project spent around a year trying to move to pyproject.toml but there was insufficient functionality in the toml-based approach to complete the transition. We invite those interested in moving this project `pyproject.toml` to contribute their efforts to making [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) work with that format."

    "# Why use `import *`\n",
    "\n",
    "First, through the use of the [__all__](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package) attribute in modules we control what actually gets imported. So there's no risk of namespace pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, our style lends itself to working in rather compact Jupyter notebooks and small Python modules. Hence we know about the source code whose libraries we `import *` from. This terseness means we can develop faster. We're a small team, and any edge we can gain is important to us. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, for external libraries, be it core Python, SQLAlchemy, or other things we do tend to use explicit imports. In part to avoid namespace collisions, and also as reference to know where things are coming from.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll finish by saying a lot of our users employ explicit imports. If that's the path you want to take, we encourage the use of `from fasthtml.common import fh`. The acronym of `fh` makes it easy to recognize that a symbol is from the FastHTML library."
