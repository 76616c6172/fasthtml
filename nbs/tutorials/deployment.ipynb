However, if you want to use your own that you've purchased through services like [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) or [Squarespace Domains](https://domains.squarespace.com/) and have users be able to navigate to your site using that domain, you'll need to configure it both in your domain registration service and in Railway. Railway has put together a nice tutorial for setting it up [here](https://docs.railway.app/guides/public-networking#custom-domains).\n",

Regular domains don't have any prefixes before the main site name such as `example.com` and is setup differently from a subdomain which might look like `subdomain.example.com`. Make sure to follow your domain registration service's documentation on how to set these types up.\n",
