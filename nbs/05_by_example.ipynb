The goal of this tutorial is to give an alternate introduction to FastHTML, building out a number of example applications to show common patterns and illustrate some of the ways you can build on top of the FastHTML foundations to create your own custom web apps. A secondary goal is to have this be a useful document to add to the context of an LLM to turn it into a useful FastHTML assistant - in fact, in some of the examples we'll see this kind of assistant in action, thanks to [this custom GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-xPqF9SZjM-fasthtml-helper).\n",

But again, we don't want to learn extra languages unless we absolutely have to! Fortunately, there are ways to get much more visually appealing sites by relying on the hard work of others, using existing CSS libraries. One of our favourites is [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/). To add a CSS file to HTML, you can use the `<link>` tag. Since we typically want things like CSS styling on all pages of our app, FastHTML lets you add shared headers when you define your app. And it already has `picolink` defined for convenience. As per the [pico docs](https://picocss.com/docs), we put all of our content inside a `<main>` tag with a class of `container`: \n"

    "Submitting the form will trigger a POST request to `/`, so next we need to generate an image and add it to the list. One problem: generating images is slow! We'll start the generation in a separate thread, but this now surfaces a different problem: we want to update the UI right away, but our image will only be ready a few seconds later. This is a common pattern - think about how often you see a loading spinner online. We need a way to return a temporary bit of UI which will eventually be replaced by the final image. Here's how we might do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def generation_preview(id):\n",

    "                   hx_post=f\"/generations/{id}\",\n",
    "                   hx_trigger='every 1s', hx_swap='outerHTML')\n",
    "    \n",
    "@app.post(\"/generations/{id}\")\n",
    "async def get(id:int): return generation_preview(id)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.post(\"/\")\n",
    "async def post(prompt:str):\n",
    "    id = len(generations)\n",
    "    generate_and_save(prompt, id)\n",
    "    generations.append(prompt)\n",
    "    clear_input =  Input(id=\"new-prompt\", name=\"prompt\", placeholder=\"Enter a prompt\", hx_swap_oob='true')\n",
    "    return generation_preview(id), clear_input\n",
    "\n",
    "@threaded\n",
    "def generate_and_save(prompt, id): ... \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The form sends the prompt to the `/` route, which starts the generation in a separate thread then returns two things:\n",
    "- A generation preview element that will be added to the top of the `gen-list` div (since that is the target_id of the form which triggered the request)\n",
    "- An input field that will replace the form's input field (that has the same id), using the hx_swap_oob='true' trick. This clears the prompt field so the user can type another prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generation preview first returns a temporary \"Generating...\" message, which polls the `/generations/{id}` route every second. This is done by setting hx_post to the route and hx_trigger to 'every 1s'. The `/generations/{id}` route returns the preview element every second until the image is ready, at which point it returns the final image. Since the final image replaces the temporary one (hx_swap='outerHTML'), the polling stops running and the generation preview is now complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works nicely - the user can submit several prompts without having to wait for the first one to generate, and as the images become available they are added to the list. You can see the full code of this example in TODO link draft1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Again, with Style\n",
    "\n",
    "The app is functional, but can be improved. The full example TODO link adds more stylish generation previews, lays out the images in a grid layout that is responsive to different screen sizes, and adds a database to track generations and make them persistent. The database part is very similar to the todo list example, so let's just quickly look at how we add the nice grid layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step one was looking around for existing components. The Pico CSS library we've been using has a rudimentary grid but recommends using an alternative layout system. One of the options listed was [Flexbox](http://flexboxgrid.com/). \n",
    "\n",
    "To use Flexbox you create a \"row\" with one or more elements. You can specify how wide things should be with a specific syntax in the class name. For example, `col-xs-12` means a box that will take up 12 columns (out of 12 total) of the row on extra small screens, `col-sm-6` means a column that will take up 6 columns of the row on small screens, and so on. So if you want four columns on large screens you would use `col-lg-3` for each item (each using 3 columns out of 12). \n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"row\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n",
    "        <div class=\"box\">This takes up the full width</div>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This was non-intuitive to me. Thankfully ChatGPT et al know CSS and popular libraries for it quite well, and we can also experiment in a notebook to test things out:"

Note these objects are just 3-element lists - you can create custom ones too as long as they're also 3-element lists. Alternately, leaf nodes can be strings instead (which is why you can do `Div('some text')`). If you pass something that isn't a 3-element list or a string, it will be converted to a string using str()... unless (our final trick) you define a `__xt__` method that will run before str(), so you can render things a custom way.\n",
